QHow can I access my Aegir system – the Provision backend and also the Hostmaster frontend directories and files, or use Aegir API?

<a name="info-a"></a>

AThis level of access is available only on our new “Aegir with Power Cores”:http://omega8.cc/power managed option, or when the system is “hosted on your own server”:http://omega8.cc/remote. When hosted with us on the managed “Aegir SSD+SAS Cores”:http://omega8.cc/buy, you have an access only to your special, non-system Aegir account, so you can easily and safely manage your platforms, sites, contrib modules, themes, libraries and all related files, but you can’t access Aegir backend and frontend directories, files or system user. This setup is designed to deliver the best possible experience, 100% fear-free, also for beginners or power users who never used Aegir before and are afraid they could break their amazing setup by accident. It is designed to be safe to use, with interface simplified when compared to original, so you can concentrate on your work instead of studying manuals.
