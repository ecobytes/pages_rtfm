# Legacy Docs

This area contains legacy docs imported as-is from our old Drupal site via WordPress bridge, because there was no direct Drupal-to-Grav importer available in July 2016, yet.

They are full of incomplete Textile-to-Markdown and some HTML leftovers, which need to be fixed before they are re-used in proper docs written in Markdown on this site.

Some of these legacy docs have been already rewritten in the meantime, but need to be updated, because the rewrite effort started in 2013, and things changed _a bit_ in the meantime. Some still need to be rewritten, though, so we are publishing them here, mainly as a supporting source for the ongoing rewrite effort, continued now, hopefully, also with **your** help!
