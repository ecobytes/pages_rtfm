Aegir

[This snippet may be useful:]

With Omega8.cc hosting, you can create, build,
and maintain multiple Drupal sites, mostly
within your web browser. Specialized,
open-source software called Aegir and BOA make
typically tricky web development tasks easy,
secure, and quick. With Omega8.cc, you don't
have to download Drupal or modules or anything
else. Just log in and start clicking.

But you also have the freedom to use tools like
FTP, ssh, drush, and git when you need to.
