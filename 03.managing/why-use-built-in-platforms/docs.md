When to Use Our Built-In Aegir Platforms

Problem: Should You Use Built-in Aegir Platforms?
-------------------------------------------------

You can either [add a custom platform](add-custom-platform) to Aegir or
use one of our [built-in platforms](built-in-platforms). Which should
you choose?

Solution: Consider the Needs of the Site
----------------------------------------

The answer depends on the particular site.

### When to Make a Custom Platform

A custom platform makes sense if:

-   You want to use a "distribution" that isn't included
    in the [list of built-in platforms.](built-in-platforms)

-   You want to use a module that is incompatible with the other modules
    on the built-in platorms.

-   You need to patch core.

### When to Use a Built-in Platform

If your site does not fit any of those conditions, consider one of our
[built-in platfroms](built-in-platforms).

Built-in platforms offer two major advantages over custom platforms:

-   Built-in platforms run on **faster hardware**.

-   Built-in platforms feature carefully chosen, patched, and
    maintained
    **modules**. You can customize these platforms by adding further
    *modules and themes.

### Fast SSD Drives

Our Omega8.cc [hybrid storage](hybrid-storage) system relies on quality
SSD
(Solid State Drive) technology to serve up your web sites with blazing
speed. But we know you also need plenty of affordable space for your
files. When you upload files, they go onto the bigger, but also
slower, SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) drives.

These SAS drives are professional grade, with far more speed and
quality than the cheap and slow SATA (Serial ATA) drives which are so
common among webhosts. But even with SAS, SSD is still faster.

**All our built-in platforms are on these faster SSD drives.** But
when you add a custom platform, it goes on the slower SAS drive.

### Patched and Curated Modules

Our built-in platforms offer a carefully selected group of modules
that should work cleanly together. You know that these particular
modules, with these particular versions, will function well.

Many of the modules, and even parts of core, also include important
patches. Sometimes, when a security release comes out for Drupal, we
can fix the problem on our platforms by patching core. With our patch,
you don't need to [migrate to an updated platform](migrate-platform).

### You Can Customize Our Built-In Platforms

We know you'll want to add your own modules for your unique sites. No
problem. You can [customize our built-in
platforms](customize-built-in-platform)
by adding modules and themes.
