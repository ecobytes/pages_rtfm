 We are happy to release BOA-2.0.3 â€“ the biggest Edition ever, which includes many new features, 8 new platforms, 17 updated platforms, new Drupal core versions and many fixes and improvements introduced in the last three months since previous Edition.

 
    ### Stable Edition BOA-2.0.3
    ### Date: Thu May 17 18:17:40 EST 2012
    ### Installs Aegir 2.0.3 compatible with Aegir 1.9
    
    # There are major improvements and new features added in this BOA Edition.
    
      Here is the description of those most important/expected, while complete
      list of all changes, new features and fixes is available further below.
    
      * Caching backend has been simplified. We no longer use chained cache
        system with Memcached+Redis+database. New system uses only Redis cache
        and the same configuration for all Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 platforms.
        This new system doesn't require any extra module to be enabled in any site.
        Complete integration is already enabled by default for every platform/site
        installed by default and for every custom platform as before - the next
        day after first site on the custom platform has been created.
        You can disable this caching layer using the same modules/cache/NO.txt
        control file as before. While there is just one cache engine (Redis) used,
        there is also an automatic, instant failover to standard database caching,
        just in case Redis is not available for some reason. You can also disable
        Redis cache on the fly for debugging by adding ?noredis=1 to any URL.
        
      * We have added support for Drupal 8.x while still using modified
        Drush 4.6-dev version, so we can still support Drupal 5 on the same
        system, but on another Octopus instance.
      
      * You can choose different PHP version for PHP-FPM (web access)
        and PHP-CLI, for even greater control over compatibility with
        various Drupal major versions.
        
      * You can choose both PHP-FPM and PHP-CLI versions per Octopus instance,
        on the same system. And you can change those versions on upgrade.
    
      * Installing and upgrading BOA system has been greatly simplified.
        You can still configure and run both installers as before,
        but you can also use these new, shockingly simple command line tools
        to install Barracuda and Octopus at once, to install more Octopus
        instances, to run selective or batch upgrades of all Octopus instances etc.
        See docs/INSTALL.txt and docs/UPGRADE.txt for details.
    
      * We have added an 'easy install' configuration shortcuts for both
        standard (public) and localhost installs. You no longer need
        to read, understand and configure all options, unless you prefer
        to choose some non-default configuration options.
    
      * Default installs on Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu Precise use
        packages for PHP 5.3, so initial setup takes just 10-15 minutes.
    
      * You can easily grant limited shell and FTPS access for developers,
        simply by creating "Clients" in the Aegir control panel and define
        them as 'owners' of one or more sites. Their access will be limited
        to only sites they can manage, but only if you will send them their
        access credentials, which are independent of their Aegir control
        panel credentials and stored in the ~/users/ directory in your main account.
        You will find there files with passwords for every "Client" with at least
        one site attached. For example ~/users/o1.username file means that
        this Client's username for SSH and FTPS access is 'o1.username' while
        his password is stored in this file. This means that SSH/FTPS access
        is not granted automatically, but you can decide who should receive it.
        How to change any extra user's password? Simply delete his file
        ~/users/o1.username and wait up to 5 minutes - the system will re-create
        his account with new password. And how to delete the user completely?
        Simply delete this user "Client" account in the Aegir control panel and
        allow the system to delete also his SSH/FTPS access in the next 5 minutes.
    
      * We have added segfault monitor for php-fpm and nginx, enabled by default.
        It is pretty aggresive, because it disables vhost of any site causing
        segfault errors and sends e-mail alert to the Octopus instance owner
        and server owner e-mail addresses. Simple site re-verify in Aegir enables
        the site again - but until the next segfault only, so read the info
        included in the e-mail alert message, if this will happen. If you prefer
        to not run this monitor: `rm -f /var/xdrago/monitor/check/segfault_alert`
    
      * Previously recommended site and platforms re-verify on Clone or Migrate
        is now fully automated. Aegir will run these extra tasks as a part
        of Clone or Migrate task, to make sure that there are no errors
        and that Aegir is using up-to-date information collected about
        platforms and sites. It also automatically fixes the known problem
        with domain aliases incorrectly written in the original and cloned sites,
        as reported in the Aegir queue: http://drupal.org/node/1004526
      
      * Apps are now fully supported. If the App is not downloaded yet, installing
        it via browser only requires write permissions, normally never available
        for the web server user, so you need to create an empty control file, either
        in sites/all/modules/apps-allow.info or sites/domain/modules/apps-allow.info
        and then run 'Reset password' task. It will open write access where required
        until the next site 'Verify' task will run . After installing the App,
        remember to re-Verify the site to restore default, safe permissions.
    
      * Custom local.settings.php file support uses similar logic with control file
        sites/domain/modules/local-allow.info and also 'Reset password' task.
        After running this task the local.settings.php file will be group writable,
        so you will be able to edit it also when logged in as limited shell user.
        Remember to run site Verify when done, to restore safe permissions.
        Note that this file is created automatically, but is not open for write
        access by default.
        
    # Notes on new and updated platforms and new Drupal core:
    
      All 6.x and 7.x platforms have been updated with latest core,
      so they are all in fact new in this BOA Edition, but we list here
      only really new platforms or those with new version released
      since last BOA Edition, with one exception: we list also basic
      6.26.2 and 7.14.2 platforms as new.
    
      NOTE: before you will try to upgrade any of your sites,
